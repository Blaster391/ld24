					<p>This page is a place to keep all of my information about <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/about-ludum-dare/">Ludum Dare</a> 24 together.</p>
					<p>All of the interesting stuff can be found at the links on the left.</p>
					<p>The game will be HTML5 canvas/javascript. I will use Chrome for development, so it is possible that it will only work in Chrome. Hopefully not!</p>
					<p>I'm using crafty.js, the GIMP, Audacity, bfxr, iNudge, Sublime Text 2, git, Dropbox, imagemagick and pen and paper.</p>

						<h1>Back from the brink</h1>
						<h6>17:40 Sun, 26th August 2012 BST</h6>
						<p>Yesterday evening I struggled through for a couple of hours and then gave up for the night. I read a book and fell asleep. This morning I started work and I just felt horrible and demoralised.</p>
						<p>At 11am I gave up. I submitted what I had (which was next to nothing) and turned off the computer. I was really disappointed and angry at myself. The whole thing had been a total failure. What a waste of time!</p>
						<p>Anyway, after an hour of moping and sulking I decided to pull myself together. I had created a platformer as my warm up so I knew I could get the basic mechanics done quickly. So, with 14 hours left I started again more or less from scratch (a little bit of drawing code, an autotracker music track, a heart sprite, etc. could be salvaged but not much.)</p>
						<p>So I've now made a simple one level platformer with some sound effects (thanks to bfxr, no thanks to my borken microphone) including some basic enemies and an end level boss.</p>
						<p>I also have a fair idea of where I'm going with the idea, post compo.</p>
						<p>So success after all? I certainly wish I'd had this idea from the start, or had given up the original idea earlier.</p>
						<p>Now I have to add in the special ingredients like menu, credits, story and maybe make the graphics a bit fancier.</p>
						<p><strong>Below:</strong> <i>Ooh, some boxes. What a wibblymat platformer looks like after 2 hours work.</i><br/><img src="screenshots/platformer.png"/></p>

						<h1>Aaaaaaaargh!</h1>
						<h6>19:58 Sat, 25th August 2012 BST</h6>
						<p>Probably 25% through the time I have available and I can see that I have bitten off more than I can chew. Going to struggle to have anything even remotely game like before the end of day 1 so going to have to spend my "polish" time finish the basic gameplay. No music/SFX/animation then...</p>
						<p>Last time my idea was too simple and I didn't like my game enough to really polish it. This time I've swung too far the other way :(</p>

						<h1>Humble beginnings</h1>
						<h6>11:29 Sat, 25th August 2012 BST</h6>
						<p>Coding has started! Spent a lot longer than expected looking after my son this morning and had some family business to sort out too.</p>
						<p>I'm certainly being more ambitious than last time. My idea is something between the original Warcraft and the combat/experience/level up mechanics from Civilization IV. Yeah...</p>
						<p>Anyway, I now have *something* drawing on the screen, so I figured that was worth a post. Bask in the glory of the green!</p>

						<p>You can see it in "action" <a href="game.html">on the game page</a> too!</p>

						<h1>Brainstorming</h1>
						<h6>05:49 Sat, 25th August 2012 BST</h6>
						<p>So, the theme is "evolution", and unlike last time I have several totally doable ideas. Just need to think hard and pick one.</p>
						<p>Been up since 5am but the adrenaline is pumping. Should be a good day!</p>

						<h1>Preparation</h1>
						<h6>17:14 Mon, 20th August 2012 BST</h6>
						<p>Preparing for LD24 by getting the site going and working on a warm-up project that I can pull apart for skeleton code.</p>
						<p>I've learnt a lot about JS since the last LD so things should go a bit smoother with the code. Time will tell!</p>
