					<h1>Wibblymat's Ludum Dare #24 Entry page</h1>
					<p>This page is a place to keep all of my information about <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/about-ludum-dare/">Ludum Dare</a> 24 together.</p>
					<p>All of the interesting stuff can be found at the links on the left.</p>
					<p>The game will be HTML5 canvas/javascript. I will use Chrome for development, so it is possible that it will only work in Chrome. Hopefully not!</p>
					<p>I'm using crafty.js, the GIMP, Audacity, bfxr, iNudge, Sublime Text 2, git, Dropbox, imagemagick and pen and paper.</p>

					<div>Once work begins, you will be able to <a href="game.html">play the game</a> as I go along</div>
					<!-- <div><h2>&gt; <a href="game.html">Play the game!</a> &lt;</h2></div> -->

						<h1>Humble beginnings</h1>
						<h6>11:29 Sat, 25th August 2012 BST</h6>
						<p>Coding has started! Spent a lot longer than expected looking after my son this morning and had some family business to sort out too.</p>
						<p>I'm certainly being more ambitious than last time. My idea is something between the original Warcraft and the combat/experience/level up mechanics from Civilization IV. Yeah...</p>
						<p>Anyway, I now have *something* drawing on the screen, so I figured that was worth a post. Bask in the glory of the green!</p>

						<p>You can see it in "action" <a href="game.html">on the game page</a> too!</p>

						<h1>Brainstorming</h1>
						<h6>05:49 Sat, 25th August 2012 BST</h6>
						<p>So, the theme is "evoluution", and unlike last time I have several totally doable ideas. Just need to think hard and pick one.</p>
						<p>Been up since 5am but the adrenaline is pumping. Should be a good day!</p>

						<h1>Preparation</h1>
						<h6>17:14 Mon, 20th August 2012 BST</h6>
						<p>Preparing for LD24 by getting the site going and working on a warm-up project that I can pull apart for skeleton code.</p>
						<p>I've learnt a lot about JS since the last LD so things should go a bit smoother with the code. Time will tell!</p>
